# Plants Segmentation

## Purpose
In this colaboratory notebook I have implemented a CNN to spot infesting weed and maize plants.The idea
was to implement this model in robot tasked with weed remotion.

## Disclaimer
Unfortunately I cannot share the dataset used since it is private. However i have decided to make this repo public because 
someone might have to face a similar task and might want to take inspiration from my code.
